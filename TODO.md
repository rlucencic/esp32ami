# esp32ami: to do

In order: "what's next" is the first item here. Each one says why, where,
how, how it's checked, and roughly how big it is. Done items move to
`docs/architecture.md` (Progress, "The to-do list") and leave this list;
the others keep their numbers (done: 1, an RP9 setting up its machine;
2, the blitter's timing slot by slot; 3, the 68000 on the chip bus slot by
slot; 4, Paula's attach modes; 5, ECS super-hires; 6, writing extended
ADFs; 7, AGA's untested and missing parts; 8, the 68EC020's instruction
cache).

## 9. Waiting on something

Nothing here can be done as things are; each says what it waits for.

- DMS modes 2-5 (quick, medium, deep, heavy 1): written after xDMS,
  untested. Needs an archive packed in one of them (none in the
  collection; no DMS packer at hand).
- The clock's saved offset keeps a clock set while the board's time was
  wrong (unlikely with the Tab5's RTC): a remark, nothing to do.
- The 68000's bus cycles where a real one has them: the slot model takes
  an instruction's back to back from its start (SysInfo 1.03, xSysInfo
  1.06 times an A600); 1.00 needs each bus cycle's place in the
  instruction (a bus-cycle 68000 core, not Musashi): a project of its
  own. Then the 2 clocks a 68000 on an odd colour clock waits could come
  back (`mem.c`: they made two loaders fail with the back-to-back cycles).
- Assembler (RISC-V, PIE) for hot paths: only if a game falls behind
  (Aerial Racers' race: core 1 71-78% with the 68EC020's cache and the
  poll skip).
- Sprites on lines inside the window without bitplanes: Denise (WinUAE)
  wants a BPL1DAT write on a line before showing them; here they show.
  Needs a game or a test on a real Amiga that shows the difference.
